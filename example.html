<h3 id="title-volunteer">Voluntary Work</h3>

<p> For my Duke of Edinburgh's award, I was required to carry out a service section, which involves providing a
service for the community. For this I did two things; I worked in the Stony Stratford Mews nursing home, and
worked in the Willen Hospice charity shop (see above). </p>

<p> In the mews, I performed general duties, such as cleaning and washing, and spent time with the residents,
getting to know them and giving them someone to talk to. </p>

<p> I am also an active member of my local church â St. Georges, in Wolverton. I volunteer at the regular fÃªtes
and fundraising events, and am a server during the Sunday morning services. </p>


<h3 id="title-achieve"> Achievements & Interests </h3> 

<p> I spend my free time in many different ways. Monday and Wednesday nights I attend a local Tang Soo Do
class (Korean self-defence). I am a black belt and help the junior members to progress. I am progressing
towards my Senior 1st Dan black belt. </p>

<p> I have recently completed my gold Duke of Edinburgh's award, having previously completed the bronze and
silver awards. Through the award, I have travelled through, and camped at, the Lake District and Peak
District national parks. I also completed the trek up Snowdon, and camped up Siabod (the second tallest
mountain, after Snowdon). </p>

<p> On the computer side of things, I am quite interested in PC games. I prefer first person shooters, my current
favourites being Unreal Tournament 2004 and Counter Strike. These games, although being violent, promote
quick reflexes, teamwork, and skill. I'm also a big fan of management games â I absolutely love the Roller
Coaster Tycoon series. These type of games entail a sense of management â buying, selling, dealing with
money. </p>


<h3> Additional Skills </h3>

<p> I am completely devoted to all aspects of web design and web page/site construction. I am fluent in
HTML/xHTML and CSS, and am competent with web creation tools such as Dreamweaver; however, I hand
code all of my work in a simple text editor. I am also devoted to proper web standards, and create all of my
work to the xHTML 1.0 spec from the W3c (www.w3.org). I help others to create lean, valid sites, which are
accessible, easy to navigate and well produced. </p>

<p> I am an active member of a CSS Forum on the Internet (www.csscreator.com), earning the rank of Guru due
to my knowledge and willingness to help learners. </p>

<p> I am also competent at graphics editing â my weapons of choice being Jasc Paint Shop Pro 9, and
Macromedia Flash MX2004 (although I would use PhotoShop, should the need arise). I create logos for
various websites, images for forums, and wallpapers for my computer desktop. </p>
